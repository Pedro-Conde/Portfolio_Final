    <!-- Case Study -->
    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Case Study</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I was tasked with developing the concept, branding guide, and wireframes for a mobile application of my choice.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>As someone who has been passionate about anime and manga culture from a young age, I noticed a clear gap in the Canadian
      market: there isn’t a dedicated online store focused solely on selling manga. Purchasing titles often means resorting to
      platforms like Amazon or Indigo, which don’t cater specifically to this niche community.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With that in mind, I designed an app dedicated entirely to selling physical manga copies, combining functionality with a
      strong, fandom-driven brand identity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Branding and wireframing are two of my favorite parts of the design process, and this project allowed me to merge both with 
      one of my biggest personal passions. It remains one of my favorite projects to date, and one that I continue to refine and expand upon.</p>

    <!-- Inspirations & Brainstorming -->
    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Research & Brainstorming</h2>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Despite the growing popularity of anime and manga in Canada, there is a noticeable lack of specialized online stores dedicated to manga sales. Fans often rely on large e-commerce platforms such as Amazon or Indigo, which offer extensive catalogs but lack cultural focus and community appeal.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>To design an app that provides a dedicated, manga-focused shopping experience, combining usability with an authentic brand identity rooted in Japanese culture and aesthetics.</p>
        <br>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The app targets anime and manga fans aged 14 and above. Most titles would be available in English, while Japanese editions would be featured for collectors. Due to the presence of mature (18A) titles, the app would implement age verification, ensuring that users under 18 can only access age-appropriate content.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
      <p>Key competitors, including Amazon and Indigo, were analyzed for their strengths in interface design, usability, and catalog size. However, both lack the niche branding and immersive community experience that manga enthusiasts seek.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Insights & Opportunity</h3>
      <p>Research revealed an opportunity to create a platform that not only sells manga but also celebrates the culture around it, offering a more personalized, authentic, and visually cohesive experience for fans.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <h3>Brand Concept</h3>
      <p>After completing the market analysis, I began developing the brand identity, starting with the name and logo, the part of the process I invested the most time and care into. I wanted a name that felt authentic, easy to read, and culturally connected to the world of anime and manga.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My goal was to find a short Japanese word that would also be simple and memorable in English. That’s when I started exploring numbers. The number seven holds significant meaning across many popular titles such as Naruto and Dragon Ball, and it also happens to be my personal favorite number. In Japanese, one of the readings of seven is “nana” (なな). It perfectly captured what I was looking for: short, recognizable, and tied to Japanese culture.</p>
      <p>And so, <b>NaNa Media</b> was born.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <p>With the name established, I moved on to defining the color system. While I naturally gravitate toward darker tones, anime culture is vibrant and expressive, filled with contrast and energy. To reflect that, I chose blue and orange as the primary brand colors, symbolizing balance between calmness and excitement.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I experimented with several shades until finding the right combination:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <b style="color: #233f94;">Blue (#233F94)</b> — representing trust, depth, and the serenity often associated with storytelling.</li>
        <li><b style="color: #ffa500;">Orange (#FFA500)</b> — conveying enthusiasm, warmth, and creativity.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>After testing the palette across logo variations and low-fidelity wireframes, the colors proved to be both bold and cohesive, aligning perfectly with the brand’s tone and purpose.</p>
      <p>The colors <b style="color: #000000;">Black (#000000)</b> and <b>Light Grey (#ebebeb)</b> were chosen as the secondary colors.</p>
